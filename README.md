# Tight-Team-Profile-Generator
This is the ten project that run in Node. This is command application that made prompt questions and requests about the members of the team . It creates information of the member such as an id, github username, school..etc...) for the HTML file to be generated and run on it owns course. Then the HTML file is created and generated by the output folder that will show up in  the browser. 


# User's Story
This is a 3 team members or more  that have three roles: Manager, Engineer and Intern (Employee is an exception). It contains an  name, a special id and email address. Manager have a special phone number, while Engineer provides their github. Unlike Manager's role, intern provides name of school. They develop a team to work on a project. Using node and inquirer packages, it  would be nice for store information for them to remember their code. 

# Motivations:

My motivation is to make electric change in my careers and learn, multiple  uncommon ways how to code as a web developer. From learning prototypes and constructors, it involves testing development, writing tests for applications for features. By  repeating the process of coding over and over again until it pass, it help code to be workable and successful to write only at the minimum.  

Another motivation is to build functional website that other clients can see and understand what is going on.
